## Project Overview
The project uses statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze cancer-related datasets. Through feature selection, preprocessing, and model training, the project builds a classifier to predict the type of cancer based on input features. This project is a demonstration of how data science can be applied in healthcare to assist in early detection.

## Dataset
- **Data Source**: The dataset used in this project is in CSV format and contains data related to cancer attributes, such as tumor size and cell characteristics.
- **Data Features**: The dataset includes several columns relevant to cancer diagnosis and prediction. Example features might include `Tumor_Size`, `Cell_Shape`, and `Clump_Thickness`.
- **Target**: The target variable represents the cancer diagnosis, which could be a binary or categorical label indicating cancer type or presence.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named `cancer.ipynb` and run each cell sequentially.
3. Ensure that the dataset files in CSV format are located in the correct directory as indicated in the notebook.
4. Modify any parameters, such as model type, data split ratio, or visualization preferences, within the notebook if customization is needed.

## Project Structure
- **`cancer.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook file that includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **`data/`**: Directory for storing the dataset files (CSV format).
- **`images/`**: Directory for saving visualizations like charts and graphs generated by the notebook.
- **`models/`**: Optional directory for saving trained model files if desired.

## Results
The project outputs various evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the model's performance. Key evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**

These metrics are used to validate and assess the model's effectiveness in predicting cancer based on the provided dataset.
