# Applying the concept of Image Difference Captioning (IDC) to the artistic context: The project aims to develop a tool to automatically describe the differences between two works of art.

# Utility for art critics and conservation of artworks: The difference analysis can support the work of critics and assist in cataloging artworks.

# Creating a dataset for this purpose: A dataset of paired art images is created to train the model.
